# HealthSync Frontend Installation Guide

This guide will help you install and run the frontend of the HealthSync project located in the `/Frontend/HealthSync` directory.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (a fast JavaScript runtime)

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/HealthSync.git
    cd HealthSync/Frontend/HealthSync
    ```

2. **Install dependencies** using `bun`:

    ```sh
    bun install
    ```

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```sh
bun run vite
```
This will start the Vite development server, and you can view the application in your browser.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during installation or running the development server, please refer to the Bun documentation or the Vite documentation.

Happy coding!
